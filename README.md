# Time Auction Simulator

This is a simulator for different strategies in for The Devil's Plan season two day two (S02E04) prison challenge, Time Auction.

## Why?

[The Devil's Plan] is a Korean reality show. It is far-and-away the most cerebral reality show we have ever seen. Each game day, the contestants play in several novel complex [social games]—think: [mafia] on steroids. These games tend to have mixture of [game theory], puzzle solving, and [social engineering]. We highly recommend it! (We watch with English dubs; don't @ us 😉) 

Most of the games in The Devil's Plan would be tedious to try to simulate in software because: the rules are complex, most actions in the game cause ripple effects which would be tedious to model, and because humans are messy. However, when watching episode 4 of season 2, we were struck by the Prison Game, Time Auction, as a game where each person could reasonably have an algorithm for how they were going to play before they walked in the game room, eschew human emotions, and execute that algorithm. And indeed, several players do come up with algorithms, and the winner did just that.

This made us wonder: what is the optimal strategy? And we [nerd-sniped] ourselves into writing this little simulator to find a _potentially_ optimal strategy. 

It's presently incomplete. The basics of the simulator live in [`main.py`](./main.py), and different strategies live in [`strats`](./strats/). We'd like to add many more strategies, and then run simulations of all combinations of those strategies to arrive at a potentially optimal strategy.

## Rules for Time Auction

_(source: <https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%8D%B0%EB%B8%94%EC%8A%A4%20%ED%94%8C%EB%9E%9C:%20%EB%8D%B0%EC%8A%A4%EB%A3%B8/2%EC%9D%BC%EC%B0%A8#s-5>)_

1. "Time Auction" is a game where you bid using time to win a token.  
2. Each player is given **10 minutes** of auction funds. Time is recorded to the nearest 0.1 second.  
3. The game consists of a total of **19 auctions**.  
4. Each player has a personal button in front of them, which is hidden from other players.  
5. At the start of a round, all players stand ready with their buttons pressed.  
6. When the auction starts, a 5-second countdown will begin, and after 5 seconds, your holding time will begin to deduct.  
   - If you do not wish to participate in the auction, you can abandon the auction by releasing the button within the countdown time.  
   - Each player's holding time is not disclosed to anyone, including themselves, and only the time during the auction can be checked on the scoreboard. In other words, you must accurately remember the time you used and participate in the auction.  
7. Players participating in the auction can release the button to stop time when the amount of time they wish to bid has been deducted.  
   - If all remaining time is used up, the button is automatically pushed out immediately. In other words, bidding beyond the remaining time is not possible.[\[27\]](https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%8D%B0%EB%B8%94%EC%8A%A4%20%ED%94%8C%EB%9E%9C:%20%EB%8D%B0%EC%8A%A4%EB%A3%B8/2%EC%9D%BC%EC%B0%A8#fn-27)  
8. When the last remaining player releases the button, the clock on the scoreboard stops and that player is awarded the winning token.  
   1. It is not disclosed who participated in the auction, only the winning bidder of that round is disclosed.  
   2. If two or more players bid using the same time to the nearest 0.1 second, the winning token for that round is lost.  
9. After 19 auctions, the player who has won the most winning tokens wins the game and one piece (used in other parts of The Devil's Plan).  
   1. If the number of markers is tied, the player with more time on the board wins the piece.  
   2. If this is still a tie, no piece will be awarded.  
10. The player who bids the fewest winning tokens is ultimately eliminated.  
    1. If the number of markers is tied, the one with less time is eliminated.
